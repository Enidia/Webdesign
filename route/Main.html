    <h1>Overview &amp; History</h1>
    <section>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Multi-scale  modeling and simulation have become major tools in the design and optimization  of novel materials and their processing. It can largely save R &amp; D cost by  providing material property data in advance so as to offer new solutions for  later experiment. In recent years, computational simulation and experiment have  been complementing each other in the field of material research, which has  promoted the development of new materials. Based on this, International  Symposium on Multi-scale Modeling &amp; Simulation of Materials was initially  held by Computational Materials Science Branch of the Chinese Materials  Research Society in 2005.<br>
        The  aims of the annual symposium are: (1) to provide an international platform for  peers abroad and at home to present recent achievements and to promote the  development in the field of multi-scale modeling and simulation of materials;  (2) to broaden the view of China&rsquo;s researchers in multi-scale computational  simulation of materials and to promote the development of computational  materials science and relevant industries in China through international  exchange and communication.<br>
      After  years&rsquo; development, the International Symposium on Multi-scale Modeling &amp;  Simulation of Materials has become one of the most influential international  conferences in the area of computational materials science. It has been  successfully held for 11 times respectively at Fudan University (2008 and  2013), Tsinghua University (2009), Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy  of Sciences (IMR, CAS) (2010 and 2017), Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, CAS  (2011), University of Science and Technology Beijing (2012), Institute of Solid  State Physics, CAS (2014), Beihang University (2015), Dalian University of  Technology (2016) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (2017). Ningbo  University is selected to hold the 12th International Symposium on Multi-scale  Modeling &amp; Simulation of Materials in 2019.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Topics</strong><br>
Invited  talks will be given by renowned scholars around the world on the development of  multi-scale computational simulation methods for materials, integration of  algorithms and software, and application of multi-scale computational  simulation of materials. Selected by committee members, some best poster awards  will be given to the young authors to encourage scientific research.<br>
The  symposium will focus on topics such as integration calculation and multi-scale  simulation methods, etc. Representatives from industries and enterprises are  also invited. Contributions are welcome on, but not limited to the following  topics: <br>
1. Machine learning and application in material science<br>
2. Model and design of new energy material<br>
3. Multi-scale  simulation of microstructure reconstruction and evolution<br>
4. Quantum simulation of many-body system<br>
5. Simulation  of soft substance and biological material<br>
6. Synthesis  of new functional material and device design<br>
7. Simulation  of Micro-nano superstructure material</p>
